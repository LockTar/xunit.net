Today, we're shipping one new release:

* **xUnit.net Analyzers `1.1.0`**

It's been 4 months since the release of [`1.0.0`](/releases/analyzers/1.0.0).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code. ðŸŽ‰

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, adding a reference to the `xunit` version `2.4.2` package will pull in `xunit.analyzers` version `1.0.0`; you can upgrade to the newer Analyzers package by taking an explicit package reference against version `1.1.0`. See [this project](https://github.com/xunit/xunit.integration/blob/bca460c71fe56ce76d7d278b165ed08d031c0702/analyzers/FullXunit/FullXunit.csproj#L9-L10) for an example.

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `1.0.0` to `1.1.0`.

### Usage Analyzers

* Fixed an issue with [xUnit1033](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1033) where the analyzers was incorrectly detecting a missing fixture when the constructor had more than one parameter. [xunit/xunit#2567](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2567){ .issue-link }

### Assertion Analyzers

* Fixed an issue with [xUnit2002](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit2002) that incorrectly flagged implicit casts from non-nullable types to nullable types as though the value were still non-nullable. [xunit/xunit#2395](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2395){ .issue-link }

* Fixed an issue with [xUnit2005](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit2005) was not correctly triggering when one of the two values was a non-nullable value (it was checking for both being non-nullable values). [xunit/xunit#2560](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2560){ .issue-link }
