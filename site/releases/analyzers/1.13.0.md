Today, we're shipping three new releases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v2 `2.8.0` ([release notes](/releases/v2/2.8.0))
* **xUnit.net Analyzers `1.13.0`**
* xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter `2.8.0` ([release notes](/releases/visualstudio/2.8.0))

It's been 2 weeks since the release of [`1.12.0`](1.12.0).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `1.12.0` to `1.13.0`.

### Usage Analyzers

* We have introduced [xUnit1048](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1048) and [xUnit1049](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1049) to flag usage of `async void` test method signatures. xUnit1048 will trigger as a warning in v2 projects, alerting the developer that `async void` test methods are no longer supported in v3 and should be converted to `async Task` instead, whereas xUnit1049 will trigger as an error in v3 projects (and also altering the user that `async ValueTask` is acceptable as well). Note that `ValueTask` support for test method signatures only exists in v3.

* **BUG:** We fixed an issue with [xUnit1047](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1047) which was causing it to report outside the intended context (that is, it was reporting on usages other than `TheoryRowData` constructors). [xunit/xunit#2914](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2914){ .issue-link }
