Today, we're shipping three new releases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `3.0.0` ([release notes](/releases/v3/3.0.0))
* **xUnit.net Analyzers `1.23.0`**
* xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter `3.1.2` ([release notes](/releases/visualstudio/3.1.2))

It's been 5 weeks since the release of [`1.22.0`](/releases/analyzers/1.22.0).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `1.22.0` to `1.23.0`.

### General

* **BUG:** We have removed batch fixer support due to issues where fixed code could be generated incorrectly due to being generated as a batch rather than individually. [xunit/xunit#3336](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3336){: .issue-link }

### Assertion Analyzers

* We have updated [xUnit1003](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1003) to detect usage of `IDataAttribute` rather than depending solely on detecting classes derived from `DataAttribute`. [xunit/xunit#3174](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3174){: .issue-link }

* We have updated [xUnit1007](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1007) to properly check for `[ClassData<>]`, which was introduced in Core Framework v3 3.0.0.

* We have added [xUnit1052](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1052) to flag cases where developers are incorrectly trying to embed instances of `ITheoryDataRow` instead of `TheoryData<>`. When using `ITheoryDataRow` (or any of its derived types, like `TheoryDataRow<>`), your theory data providers should return `IEnumerable<...>` rather than `TheoryData<...>`. [xunit/xunit#3113](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3113){: .issue-link }

### Extensibility Analyzers

* We have created [xUnit3003](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit3003) to flag classes which extend `FactAttribute` (directly or indirectly) which do not provide a constructor that collects and passes along source location information (file name and line number). This is used to provide source information to Microsoft Testing Platform runners, like Test Explorer and `dotnet test`, to link tests to their source code.

  This analyzer is only applicable to projects which are linked against xUnit.net v3 version `3.0.0` or later.
