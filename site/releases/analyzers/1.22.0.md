## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `1.21.0` to `1.22.0`.

### Assertion Analyzers

* **BUG:** The analyzer for [xUnit1004](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1004) had not been updated to take account for `SkipWhen` or `SkipUnless` with v3 tests. It should no longer trigger in that scenario. [xunit/xunit#2988](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2988){: .issue-link }
