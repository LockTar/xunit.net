Today, we're shipping two new prereleases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `3.0.0-pre.15` ([release notes](/releases/v3/3.0.0-pre.15))
* **xUnit.net Analyzers `1.23.0-pre.3`**

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `1.22.0` to `1.23.0-pre.3`.

### Extensibility Analyzers

* We have created [xUnit3003](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit3003) to flag classes which extend `FactAttribute` (directly or indirectly) which do not provide a constructor that collects and passes along source location information (file name and line number). This is used to provide source information to Microsoft Testing Platform runners, like Test Explorer and `dotnet test`, to link tests to their source code.

  This analyzer is only applicable to projects which are linked against xUnit.net v3 version `3.0.0` or later.
