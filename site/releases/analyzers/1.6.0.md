## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `1.5.0` to `1.6.0`.

### Usage Analyzers

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue with [xUnit1035](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1035) where enum values in `[MemberData]` method arguments were incorrectly triggered as incompatible. [xunit/xunit#2817](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2817){ .issue-link }

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue with [xUnit1039](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1039) which mistakenly categorized generic typed parameters as incompatible with all theory data. Note that this fix does not attempt to resolve any generic type constraints; if you provide data that violates a generic type constraint, that will be raised at runtime rather than during analysis. [xunit/xunit#2819](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2819){ .issue-link }

### Assertion Analyzers

* Updated [xUnit2007](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit2007) to account for the fact that `abstract static` methods in interfaces are not eligible for use as generic types, which caused the fixer to create broken code. The rule will no longer trigger, and the fix will no longer be offered. [xunit/xunit#2798](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2798){ .issue-link }

* Added [xUnit2023](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit2023) to suggest replacing usage of `Assert.Collection` with a single lambda instead with `Assert.Single` (and moving the lambda's code out into the body of the unit test). [xunit/xunit#2123](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2123){ .issue-link }
