Today, we're shipping three new releases:

* **xUnit.net Core Framework v2 `2.6.4`**
* xUnit.net Analyzers 1.8.0 ([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.8.0))

It's been 2 weeks since the release of [`2.6.3`](2.6.3).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `2.6.3` to `2.6.4`.

### Assertion Library

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue introduced with the preference for `IEquatable<T>` over `IEnumerable<T>` when the value types in a dictionary were of differing types. This manifested as an `InvalidCastException` being thrown while trying to compare values in the dictionary against each other. [xunit/xunit#2850](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2850){ .issue-link }

### Runner Utility

* **BUG:** Fixed a race condition introduced by `ExecutionSink` in 2.6.3 which was causing runners to sometimes trigger an `ObjectDisposedException` while finishing running an assembly. This was more easily reproduced in low CPU thread count conditions (more common in CI environments than developer machines). [xunit/visualstudio.xunit#396](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/396){ .issue-link }
