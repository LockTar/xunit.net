Today, we're shipping three new releases:

* **xUnit.net Core Framework v2 `2.5.2`**
* xUnit.net Analyzers 1.4.0 ([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.4.0))
* xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter 2.5.3 ([release notes](/releases/visualstudio/2.5.3))

It's been 1 month since the release of v2 [`2.5.1`](2.5.1).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `2.5.1` to `2.5.2`.

### Assertion Library

* **BUG:** Fixed another regression in `Assert.Equal` with collections of dictionaries (i.e., `List<Dictionary<TKey,TValue>>`). [xunit/xunit#2755](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2755#issuecomment-1731286288){ .issue-link }

### Runner Utility

* This release removes the following types from `xunit.runner.utility`:

  * `VisualStudioSourceInformationProvider`
  * `DiaNavigationData`
  * `DiaSession`
  * `DiaSessionWrapper`
  * `DiaSessionWrapperHelper`

  These types existed solely to support the `xunit.runner.visualstudio` runner, as they provide access to source information from within Visual Studio. The code has been moved there.

* Related to the item above, `XunitFrontController` will no longer attempt to create and provide an instance of `VisualStudioSourceInformationProvider` to the `Xunit1` or `Xunit2` classes, in the event that the developer did not pass a source information provider during creation. Instead, it will always now pass a `NullSourceInformationProvider` instead.
