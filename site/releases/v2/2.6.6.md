Today, we're shipping two new releases:

* **xUnit.net Core Framework v2 `2.6.6`**
* xUnit.net Analyzers 1.10.0 ([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.10.0))

It's been 2 weeks since the release of [`2.6.5`](2.6.5).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `2.6.5` to `2.6.6`.

### Core Framework

* We have back-ported (from v3) support for classes that derive from [`BeforeAfterTestAttribute`](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/blob/v2/src/xunit.core/Sdk/BeforeAfterTestAttribute.cs) to be able to be applied at assembly level (in addition to the current support at method and class level). Use the `[assembly: MyBeforeAfterTest]` syntax to add these, and they will be invoked before and after every test in the assembly. [xunit/xunit#2334](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2334){ .issue-link }

### Packaging

* We have fixed the NuGet packages so that we offer additional dependency groups, which should eliminate security warnings when using .NET Standard 2.0+, .NET Core 2.0+, and .NET 5+. These were caused by old packages from .NET Standard 1.1/.NET Core 1.0 which have been fixed in later platforms. [xunit/xunit#2862](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2862){ .issue-link }
