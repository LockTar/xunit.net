Today, we're shipping two new releases:

* **xUnit.net Core Framework v2 `2.6.5`**
* xUnit.net Analyzers 1.9.0 ([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.9.0))

It's been 2 weeks since the release of [`2.6.4`](/releases/v2/2.6.4).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `2.6.4` to `2.6.5`.

### Core Framework

* We have converted the `TheoryData` base class to `IReadOnlyCollection<object[]>` instead of just `IEnumerable<object[]>`, which means you can now index the items and get an item count. Additionally, we've added two constructors to `TheoryData<T>` (one taking `IEnumerable<T>` and one taking `params T[]`) and an `AddRange` method so that it can more easily be used with array-style initializers.
