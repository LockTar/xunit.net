Today, we're shipping one new release:

* **xUnit.net Core Framework v2 `2.6.0`**

It's been 2 weeks since the release of [`2.5.3`](2.5.3).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `2.5.3` to `2.6.0`.

### Core Framework

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue where trying to use an enum with a negative value in `[InlineData]` where the current locale is one which uses [Unicode U+2212](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2212) as the minus sign for integers rather than [Unicode U+002D](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+002D), which caused [`Enum.Parse`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.enum.parse) to fail. Additionally we have opened an issue against .NET to try to get a "known safe to roundtrip" value from `Enum.ToString()` that would make this workaround unnecessary, as all overloads of `Enum.ToString()` that take format providers (aka cultures) are marked as obsolete and the format provider is ignored.

### Assertion Library

* We have added a new `net6.0` target to `xunit.assert`, along with the existing `netstandard1.1` target. This new target enables assertion overloads that support `Span<T>` and `Memory<T>` (and their read-only counterparts), overloads that support `ValueTask` and `ValueTask<T>` for asynchronous operations (in places where we already supported `Task` and `Task<T>`), and overloads that support `ImmutableHashSet` and `ImmutableDictionary`. Developers whose test projects target .NET 6 (or later) will automatically get access to these new assertion methods. Note that this may introduce new compiler ambiguities due to the additional overloads; for more information, see [issue 2793](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2793).<br /> <strong>Important note: `ValueTask` support only applies to the assertion library. Test methods must return either `Task` or `void` if they are async; `ValueTask` is not supported in this scenario until v3.</strong>

* We have added a try/catch inside `Assert.Equals` to catch when exceptions are thrown when calling a user-defined comparer (either a comparer function, or an implementation of `IEqualityComparer<T>`). Previously this would just surface as the exception being the cause of the failure; now it will show an `Assert.Equal() Failure` message (which includes the collection including a pointer into the collection, when the thing being compared is an item in a collection) as well as the exception that was thrown. This should greatly help in debugging user-provided comparison functions to understand which data item caused the exception. [xunit/xunit#2800](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2800){ .issue-link }

* We have added special handling for `KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>` when using `Assert.Equal` (including when what you're comparing is a collection of key/value pairs). We already had special handling for dictionaries with special equality handling for the key and the value; this extends that behavior to the "dictionary-like" situation of `IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<>>` as well. [xunit/xunit#2803](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2803){ .issue-link }

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue where some implementations of `GetHashCode` were throwing `NotImplementedException`, causing some code paths for `Assert.Equal` to throw when the hash code was needed. [xunit/xunit#2804](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2804){ .issue-link }

* **BUG:** Fixed a significant performance regression related to `Assert.Equal` with collections. In some situations, the comparison could take as much as 10x (1000%) longer as in 2.4.2. Most of the performance issues have been resolved, and the new collection assertion is within 10% of the older assertions (and in some cases on .NET 6+, the new collection comparison can be a few orders of magnitude faster, for arrays of unmanaged values).
