Today, we're shipping one new releases:

* **xUnit.net Core Framework v2 `2.6.1`**

It's been 2 days since the release of [`2.6.0`](2.6.0).

This release addresses a compiler ambiguity introduced in 2.6.0.

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `2.6.0` to `2.6.1`.

### Assertion Library

* With the release of the `net6.0` target for `xunit.assert` introduced several compiler ambiguities related to support for `ValueTask`. These come about when using an async lambda to call these functions, as the compiler does not know whether to generate the lambda to return `Task` or `ValueTask` (as both are legal). As such, we have removed/replaced all `ValueTask` support.

  This includes conversions (for net-new async assertions which are currently `ValueTask` only):

  * `Assert.AllAsync<T>(IEnumerable<T>, Func<T, ValueTask>)` to<br />
    `Assert.AllAsync<T>(IEnumerable<T>, Func<T, Task>)`

  * `Assert.CollectionAsync<T>(IEnumerable<T>, params Func<T, ValueTask>[])` to<br />
    `Assert.CollectionAsync<T>(IEnumerable<T>, params Func<T, Task>[])`

  And removals (for new async overloads):

  * `Assert.PropertyChangedAsync(INotifyPropertyChanged, string, Func<ValueTask>)`
  * `Assert.RaisesAnyAsync(Action<EventHandler>, Action<EventHandler>, Func<ValueTask>)`
  * `Assert.RaisesAnyAsync<T>(Action<EventHandler<T>>, Action<EventHandler<T>>, Func<ValueTask>)`
  * `Assert.RaisesAsync<T>(Action<EventHandler<T>>, Action<EventHandler<T>>, Func<ValueTask>)`
  * `Assert.Throws<T>(string?, Func<ValueTask>)`
  * `Assert.ThrowsAnyAsync<T>(Func<ValueTask>)`
  * `Assert.ThrowsAsync(Type, Func<ValueTask>)`
  * `Assert.ThrowsAsync<T>(Func<ValueTask>)`
  * `Assert.ThrowsAsync<T>(string?, Func<ValueTask>)`

  Developers who may now experience compiler failures after utilizing the `ValueTask` overloads should add `.AsTask()` to the end of their `ValueTask` returning code inside the lambda to convert the `ValueTask` into a `Task` and allow the code to compile.
