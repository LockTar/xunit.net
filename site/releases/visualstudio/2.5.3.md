Today, we're shipping three new releases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v2 `2.5.2` ([release notes](/releases/v2/2.5.2))
* xUnit.net Analyzers `1.4.0` ([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.4.0))
* **xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter `2.5.3`**

It's been 1 month since the release of [`2.5.1`](/releases/visualstudio/2.5.1).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code. ðŸŽ‰

_(In case you're wondering where 2.5.2 went...we discovered a bug while doing verification on the final builds, so we didn't ship 2.5.2. Instead, we fixed the bug and verified the fix, and then created the 2.5.3 release.)_

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `2.5.1` to `2.5.3`.

### Features and Fixes

* The following types were moved here from `xunit.runner.utility`:

  * `VisualStudioSourceInformationProvider`
  * `DiaNavigationData`
  * `DiaSession`
  * `DiaSessionWrapper`
  * `DiaSessionWrapperHelper`

  The runner now creates these types directly and passes them to `XunitFrontController`.

* **BUG:** The built-in reporters (including auto-reporters to support TeamCity, AppVeyor, and VSTS/Azure Pipelines) were broken in 2.5.1 with the [assembly merge](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/383). [xunit/visualstudio.xunit#384](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/384){ .issue-link }

* **BUG:** The assembly merge that was part of the fix for [xunit/visualstudio.xunit#383](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/383) caused problems with third party runner reporters, and has been rolled back. The original issue in #383 was determined to be unfixable on our end, and the suggested fix for developers who have version conflicts with `xunit.runner.utility` is to perform the IL merge that we were performing, except against their code rather than ours. [xunit/visualstudio.xunit#385](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/385){ .issue-link }

* **BUG:** We fixed an issue with `dotnet test` on non-Windows platforms with .NET Framework, when app domains are enabled. This manifested with the following error:

  ```text
  Catastrophic failure: System.TypeLoadException: Could not load type of field
  'Xunit.Runner.VisualStudio.VsExecutionSink:recorder' (3) due to: Could not load
  file or assembly 'Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestPlatform.ObjectModel, Version=15.0.0.0,
  Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies.
  ```

  The fix was to add a dependency to `Microsoft.TestPlatform.ObjectModel` for .NET Framework projects. If you had previously done this by hand to work around this issue, you can now remove your added dependency. [microsoft/vstest#2469](https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/issues/2469){ .issue-link }
