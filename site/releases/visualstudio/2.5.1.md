Today, we're shipping three new releases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v2 `2.5.1` ([release notes](/releases/v2/2.5.1))
* xUnit.net Analyzers `1.3.0` ([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.3.0))
* **xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter `2.5.1`**

It's been 2 months since the release of [`2.5.0`](/releases/visualstudio/2.5.0).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `2.5.0` to `2.5.1`.

### Features and Fixes

* We have added the ability to pass configuration values via RunSettings (either via a RunSettings file, or via the command line with `dotnet test`). See [the documentation](/docs/config-runsettings) for how to use this feature. [xunit/visualstudio.xunit#378](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/378){ .issue-link }

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue where sometimes you could not filter tests by `FullyQualifiedName` and/or `DisplayName` (during discovery). [xunit/visualstudio.xunit#380](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/380){ .issue-link }

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue where file copies of `xunit.runner.utility.*.dll` and `xunit.runner.reporters.*.dll` could overwrite versions being used by runner authors, which would manifest as runtime issues like missing method exceptions. Fixing this required IL merging the output so those two DLLs don't exist on disk any more in the final `xunit.runner.visualstudio` NuGet package. Note that we still ship and copy `xunit.abstractions.dll` because that DLL has been frozen in time since we shipped v2 2.0 of the core framework (in 2015); any copy operations would result in the same file. We cannot IL merge this dependency, because it's needed on disk so that it has the same  identity in both the runner process and the `AppDomain` that's created to run .NET Framework tests.
