## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `2.5.5` to `2.5.6`.

### Features and Fixes

* **BUG:** Fixed a race condition introduced by `ExecutionSink` in Core Framework v2 2.6.3 which was causing runners to sometimes trigger an `ObjectDisposedException` while finishing running an assembly. This was more easily reproduced in low CPU thread count conditions (more common in CI environments than developer machines). This runner build includes that fix. [xunit/visualstudio.xunit#396](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/396){ .issue-link }

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue where Visual Studio Test Explorer would output a message stating `Failed to load extensions from file 'xunit.runner.visualstudio.dotnetcore.testadapter.dll'` when discovering or running tests for .NET Framework. (The message was benign, so the only change here is that the message is no longer being generated.)
