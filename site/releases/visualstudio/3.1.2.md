Today, we're shipping three new releases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `3.0.0` ([release notes](/releases/v3/3.0.0))
* xUnit.net Analyzers `1.23.0` ([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.23.0))
* **xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter `3.1.2`**

It's been 5 weeks since the release of [`3.1.1`](/releases/visualstudio/3.1.1).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `3.1.1` to `3.1.2`.

### Features and Fixes

* We have bumped up the "crash detection" idle message timeout from 5 seconds to 60 seconds, to help eliminate potential false positives related to crashing when running tests on slower machines.
