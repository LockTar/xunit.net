Today, we're shipping three new releases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v2 `2.7.0` ([release notes](/releases/v2/2.7.0))
* xUnit.net Analyzers `1.11.0` ([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.11.0))
* **xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter `2.5.7`**

It's been 2 months since the release of [`2.5.6`](/releases/visualstudio/2.5.6).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `2.5.6` to `2.5.7`.

### Features and Fixes

* We have fixed a package signing issue which was causing `xunit.abstractions.dll` to be re-signed despite already being signed, which then caused double-writes when the file was being copied during builds. This did not cause any runtime issues, as the binaries were still identical, but it did cause occasional unnecessary rebuilds (especially for .NET Framework projects) because of the competing files. (This was also true for `xunit.runner.reporters.*.dll` and `xunit.runner.utility.*.dll`, though that was less common as it would only affect writers of third party runners.)
