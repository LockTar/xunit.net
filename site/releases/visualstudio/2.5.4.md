Today, we're shipping three new releases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v2 `2.6.2` ([release notes](/releases/v2/2.6.2))
* xUnit.net Analyzers `1.6.0` ([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.6.0))
* **xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter `2.5.4`**

It's been 5 weeks since the release of [`2.5.3`](2.5.3).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `2.5.3` to `2.5.4`.

### Features and Fixes

* We have added a new `SilentReporter`, which can be selected with a `RunnerSwitch` value of `silent` via [RunSettings](/docs/config-runsettings). This reporter is designed to block all messages (other than the copyright banner/logo). This was requested for `xunit.runner.visualstudio` because of the habit of `dotnet test` to output some notices twice (once from our adapter, and once from VSTest). Note that this is not the default, so if you are among the users who are bothered by the double reporting in VSTest, this reporter is for you (and must be enabled via RunSettings).

* **BUG:** We were ignoring [`stopOnFail`](/docs/config-xunit-runner-json#stopOnFail) when synchronous message reporting was requested. The most common trigger for this situation was disabling test collection parallelization while using `xunit.runner.visualstudio`. (This is actually a core framework bug whose fix is part of [2.6.2](/releases/v2/2.6.2).) [xunit/visualstudio.xunit#392](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/392){ .issue-link }
