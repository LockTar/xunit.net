Today, we're shipping two new prereleases:

* **xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `3.0.0-pre.15`**
* xUnit.net Analyzers `1.23.0-pre.3` ([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.23.0-pre.3))

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a list of changes from `2.0.3` to `3.0.0-pre.15`.

_**This release contains breaking changes as indicated by the major version bump. Binary compatibility with `2.x.y` packages is not guaranteed, and extensibility projects should verify whether these breaking changes affect them as they may be required to issue new versions.**_

### Core Framework

* We have added a new property `Label` to the theory data row classes and theory data attributes. Developers can set the `Label` property to influence the parameter display for test cases with theory data:

  * Unset (or set to `null`) will use the existing behavior: `TestMethod(...parameters...)`
  * Set to an empty string will remove the parameter list: `TestMethod`
  * Set to a non-empty string will add the label to the display name: `TestMethod [LabelValue]`

  This will be most commonly used when combined to either label tests with complex parameters with a simpler label, or remove the parameters when combined with custom display names that already include all the necessary information for differentiating theory data rows from one another. _Note that if you set this value on both the data attribute and the data row, the value from the data row will take precedence._ [xunit/xunit#3300](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3300){: .issue-link }

* We have added new properties (`SkipType`, `SkipUnless`, and `SkipWhen`) to the theory data row classes and theory data attributes. These mirror the properties that were already available on `FactAttribute`, and allow data rows to be conditionally skipped. _Note that if you set these values on both the data attribute and the data row, the value from the data row will take precedence._ [xunit/xunit#3314](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3314){: .issue-link }

* **Breaking change:** The type of `TestContext.Current.KeyValueStorage` has changed:

  * 2.0.3: `Dictionary<string, object?>`
  * 3.0.0: `ConcurrentDictionary<string, object?>`

  This change was made to accommodate race conditions that could exist when reading or writing shared values from multiple tests and/or multiple extensibility points. [xunit/xunit#3306](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3306){: .issue-link }

* **Breaking change:** For v3 test projects, we have opted to use `[CallerFilePath]` and `[CallerLineNumber]` decorated onto `FactAttribute` and `TheoryAttribute` rather than `CecilSourceInformationProvider`. This should improve both performance and reliability for retrieving source location information. This is a binary breaking change only; there should be no compilation issues caused by these changes, as the new parameters are (by design) decorated with default values.

  Tests should not try to set these values manually as they will be provided automatically by the compiler. [xunit/xunit#3304](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3304){: .issue-link }

### Assertion Library

* **Breaking change:** We have removed an obsolete overload of `CollectionTracker.AreCollectionsEqual`. This was marked obsolete in 2.0.0 with a warning about being removed in the next major version.

### Extensibility

* **Breaking change:** We have added a new property (`Label`) to `ITheoryDataRow` and `IDataAttribute`.

* **Breaking change:** We have added three new properties (`SkipType`, `SkipUnless`, and `SkipWhen`) to `IDataAttribute`, `ITheoryDataRow`, and `IXunitTest`. The constructor for `XunitTest` was updated to accommodate these new values.

* **Breaking change:** We have added two new properties (`SourceFilePath` and `SourceLineNumber`) to `IFactAttribute`. The new `FactAttribute` constructor (mentioned above) sets these values.

  Any extensibility point which creates its own attributes derived (directly or indirectly) from `FactAttribute` will want to provide these same constructor arguments, or else source location information will be unavailable for tests decorated with such attributes. We have added an [analyzer rule](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit3003) to detect this situation, since the compiler will not be helpful to discover the change.

* **Breaking change:** The existing `ExecutionErrorTestCase` constructor has been marked as obsolete, replaced by a new constructor that includes two new parameters (`sourceFilePath` and `sourceLineNumber`). The old constructor will be removed in the next major release.

* **Breaking change:** The existing `TestIntrospectionHelper.GetTestCaseDetails` has been marked as obsolete, replaced by a new overload that includes a new `label` parameter. The old overload will be removed in the next major version.

* **Breaking change:** The return type from `TestIntrospectionHelper` methods `GetTestCaseDetails` and `GetTestCaseDetailsForTheoryDataRow` now include two new values in the unnamed tuple return value: `SourceFilePath` and `SourceLineNumber`.

* **Breaking change:** We have added a new property (`TestMethodArity`) to `ITestCaseMetadata` and `ITestMethodMetadata` to support a new requirement from Microsoft Testing Platform 1.7 that requires method arity for test case metadata. This has a downstream impact on `ITestCaseDiscovered`, `ITestCaseStarting`, and `ITestMethodStarting`, as well as the classes which implement all of these interfaces.

  Note that arity will only be available for messages from v3 test projects; this information is not back-ported for v1 or v2, and will return as `null`. [microsoft/testfx#5516](https://github.com/microsoft/testfx/issues/5516){: .issue-link }

### Microsoft Testing Platform

* Microsoft.Testing.Platform dependencies have been updated to `1.7.1`.

* Test attachments are now supported by Test Explorer, in addition to `dotnet test`. [xunit/xunit#3227](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3227){: .issue-link }

* We have added support for [`testconfig.json`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/testing/microsoft-testing-platform-config#testconfigjson) when running in Microsoft Testing Platform mode. For more information, see [our `testconfig.json` documentation](/docs/testconfig-json-mtp). [xunit/xunit#3247](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3247){: .issue-link }
